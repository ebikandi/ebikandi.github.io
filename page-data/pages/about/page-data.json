In some aspect I identify myself with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dan_abramov\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Dan Abramov’s</a> tagline <strong><em>“Junior Developer for Life”</em></strong> because I am always willing to improve myself and go for the extra mile. I have been participating on a wide diversity of projects, from researching in <a href=\"http://ixa.si.ehu.es/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">IXA taldea</a> to comercial software development for eCommerces, always trying to give the 100% and create good atmosphere and team cohesion.</p>\n<p>These last years I have worked mostly with JavaScript in both backend and frontend, but most of the time in the front. I have worked with Angular, Vue and React, being the last the one I know and like the most. Currently, in my everyday job I work with TypeScript, React, Redux, Jest, Enzyme and React-Testing-lib.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I consider myself as a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shaped_skills\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">t-shaped</a> developer and I like to be aware of and contribute on other aspects of the project I am working on. Thus, I like to give a hand also in the backend, check some CI/CD pipelines or help with the definition of our user-stories. In addition, I have been working following <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Extreme Programming</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Agile</a> principles with Scrum, with 2 week long sprints working in squads formed by 4 to 6 mates.</p>\n<p>Also I have become a <a href=\"https://theegg.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Theegg.ai</a> student, which is a new disrupted school to deep dive into AI. I think that Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence are game-changing technologies which are going to be key in the future. So I reckon that these need to be invested on and democratized for anybody who wants to work with them.</p>\n<p>If you want to know more from me, <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1gtNQcALLoBTP323XrxzzTCn_sr8kaEzddSiy9ZkJ2zc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">here you can access my CV</a>.
